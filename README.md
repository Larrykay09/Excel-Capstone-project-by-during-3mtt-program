Final Excel Superstore Capstone Project during 3mtt program
# 🧾 Superstore Sales Dashboard (Excel Project)

## 📌 Overview

- Shipping mode preferences  
- Product return impact on revenue  
 🔍 Key Insights
- The majority of sales are driven by Telephones & Office Machines.
- 77% of products are shipped via Delivery Truck.
- $2K in returned products accounts for ~1.15% of total sales — a potential area for revenue leakage.
- Interactive filters (Slicers) allow real-time exploration by **Category** and **Region**.
